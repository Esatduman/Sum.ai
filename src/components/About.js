        <p className='about_p'>I developed a web application designed to summarize user prompts, 
            making it an invaluable tool for efficiently condensing and understanding information.
             I created this app to streamline my study process, especially when preparing for final exams, 
             where clear and concise summaries can enhance focus and comprehension. Built using React.js for 
             the front-end and integrated with OpenAI's API for summarization, this project showcases my ability
              to solve real-world problems through innovative software solutions.
